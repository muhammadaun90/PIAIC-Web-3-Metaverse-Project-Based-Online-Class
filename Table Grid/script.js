/* 1. Create a grid array variable.
2. Set a value of 64 for the number of cells.
3. Set a counter to 0.
Don't worry, we will cover this function and many more in detail
in Chapter 8, Built-in JavaScript Methods.
4. Create a global variable to be used for the row array.
5. Create a loop that will iterate up to the number of cells you want in the array,
plus one to include the zero value. In our example, we would use 64+1.
6. Add an outer if statement, which uses modulo to check if the main counter
is divisible by 8 or whatever number of columns you want.
7. Inside the preceding if statement, add another if statement to check if the
row is undefined, indicating whether it is the first run or whether the row
is complete. If the row has been defined, then add the row to the main grid
array.
8. To finish off the outer if statement, if the counter is divisible by 8, clear the
row array—it has already been added to the grid by the inner if statement.
9. At the end of the for loop, increment of the main counter by 1.
10. Set up a temporary variable to hold the value of the counter and push it to
the row array.
11. Within the loop iteration, check if the value of the counter is equal to the total
number of columns you want; if it is, then add the current row to the grid.
12. Please note that the extra cell will not be added to the grid since there aren't
enough cells to make a new row within the condition that adds the rows to
the grid. An alternative solution would be to remove the +1 from the loop
condition and add grid.push(row) after the loop is completed, both of which
will provide the same solution output.
13. Output the grid into the console. */
